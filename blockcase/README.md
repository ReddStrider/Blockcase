# Blockcase
Blockcase is a tool for minecraft that packs many command blocks into one.

It was made because any no other one-command-generators I can find work in 1.19.4+

Enjoy my spagetti code that only an italian could love!

It's just an HTML file so it doesn't need anything special to run.
Maybe I'll make an electron app or somethin...

Also if you want to use any assets or code go for it!

There's a folder called "toastcraft" that includes a JS file and a CSS file that if you add to your HTML lets you add Minecraft "toast" messages to your site.
